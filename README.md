## Getting Started

#### SAMURAI Installation 

SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install **the SAMURAI version** of SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:
```
cd sam2
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Please see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/INSTALL.md) from the original SAM 2 repository for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

#### SAM 2.1 Checkpoint Download

```
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```

#### Dataset Preparation

#### Run SAMURAI

## Acknowledgment

SAMURAI is built on top of [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Meta FAIR.

The VOT evaluation code is modifed from [VOT Toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit) by Luka ÄŒehovin Zajc.
